# ModelS4Apnea: Leveraging Structured State Space Models for Efficient Sleep Apnea Detection from ECG Signals

## Introduction
Source code for ModelS4Apnea developed for the paper "ModelS4Apnea: Leveraging Structured State Space Models for Efficient Sleep Apnea Detection from ECG Signals"

## Description
The model was trained and evaluated on Apnea-ECG dataset

The architecture of ModelS4Apnea:

## Training
The model can be trained from scratch using the Jupyter notebook: `main.ipynb` Note that ECG data and labels should be downloaded from https://physionet.org/content/apnea-ecg/1.0.0/ . 

## Evaluation
Model can be evaluated the Jupyter notebooks: `main.ipynb` after training or loading weights. Weights of the pre-trained model can be found in https://github.com/hasanzan/ModelS4Apnea/.
